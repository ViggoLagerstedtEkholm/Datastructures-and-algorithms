Datastructures and algorithm labs

During my course in Datastructures and algorithms I finished 4 labs.

1. Lab 1 - This lab covers queue and the stack data structure.
2. Lab 2 - This lab covers merge sort and insertion sort.
3. Lab 3 - This lab covers binary search tree.
4. Lab 4 - This lab covers graphs and specifically the bellman ford algorithm.

In lab 4 I wanted to create a maze solver using the bellman ford algorithm but it's not quite done yet!
